# <p align=center>Awesome Medical Image Registration</p>
<p align=center>A collection of medical image registration papers and source codes</p>

## *Description*
The importance of image registration in medical imaging is often underrepresented at MICCAI, largely dueto the complexity of applying deep learning to its ill-posed nature without real ground truth. In response, the ***MICCAI Special Interest Group in Biomedical Image Registration ([MICCAI SIG-BIR](https://miccai.org/index.php/special-interest-groups/bir/))*** is launching several initiatives aimed at uniting the fragmented image registration community and promoting research in the field. One such initiative is the creation of an ***Awesome Medical Image Registration*** GitHub page that will curate well-documented, out-of-the-box code applicable to at least two *Learn2Reg* tasks. *Learn2Reg is a public computational challenge organized by MICCAI SIG-BIR, featuring 12 datasets with labels and multiple active leaderboards.
